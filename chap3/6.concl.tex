\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

This chapter described the coarray features in the context of XMP and 
characteristic implementation of the coarray translator.

For memory allocation and registration, RS, RA and CA methods were
implemented corresponding to the communication library GASNet, FJ-RDMA
and MPI-3.

For the coarray PUT and GET communications, DMA and four buffering methods
were described. The effect of the non-blocking PUT communication was
analyzed, and the knowledge is used to make the coarray version Himeno benchmark
from the original MPI version.
The measurement result on 1024 nodes of the K computer, the coarray version 
is 27\% and 42\% faster than the original MPI version, respectively for sizes
L and XL.
The effect of the optimization of GET communication was also obvious on 
the ping-pong benchmark on HA-PACS/TCA and Fujitsu PRIMEHPC FX100.

As an evaluation of productivity, the coarray program uses less than half as
many characters as MPI message passing program to write the same algorithm
of Himeno benchmark.
